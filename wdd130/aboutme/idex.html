    <h1>All About Me
    <h2>P.S. Me = David Moore</h2>
    <p>As stated above, my name is David Moore. I am a Software Engineer major. I have returned to school after a long hiatus and am suprisingly excited for the 50 credits ahead of me. Coming back to school now is an attempt to change careers now that my wife has finished her education. I am down to try out just about anything. My son and I are avid rock climbers. Additionally, I love to play D&D, cook, overconsume youtube on the porcelain throne, and am working on my first playthrough of Hollow Knight. This class is interesting to me because it presents me with the basics of how websites work. I'm learning about computer hardware, programming, and websites all at once and I really like the rounded feel all of these classes have. They each seem to compliment each other nicely.

        President Gordon B. Hinkley states in chapter six of the Teachings of the Prophets manual" 
        </a>
    "The trouble with most of our prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceriesâ€”we place our order and hang up. We need to meditate, contemplate, think of what we are praying about and for and then speak to the Lord as one man speaketh to another"
