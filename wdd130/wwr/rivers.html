            <p class="river-description">
                Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon
                was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it
                because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty
                of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the
                river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. 
                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers 
                in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early 
                summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families 
                with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

            <p class="river-description">
                Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere,
                the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs,
                beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.
                This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) 
                and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and
                historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

            <h2 class="river-name">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
            <p class="river-description">
                This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the great grand daddy of all river trips. You will never
                forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class
                whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience.
                The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are 
                technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
                However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
